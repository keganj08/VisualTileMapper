# Visual Tile Mapper

This is a simple web-based tool for use in 2D game development where game maps are defined using 2D integer arrays. 

It provides a GUI for loading in map tiles, assigning integers to them, arranging them on a grid, and generating a corresponding txt file from which the array can be created.
